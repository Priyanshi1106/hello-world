# hello-world

My first repository

Learning how to use github and will use it to track the versions of my code. 

I go crazy sometimes and fill like throwing things far away into space. Maybe 
I can throw all the junk that's accumulated here up there. 

Good thing hello-world automatically means that I can write anything in it.
